**Bio.** I am a senior researcher & Team Lead (AI for Big Data) in the department of data platform, TEG, Tencent inc. 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Peking University in June 2022, advised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). 
And I spent one wonderful semester at ETH Zurich in 2019, working with [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/).
I have published 30+ papers in the top database (SIGMOD, VLDB), data mining (KDD, WWW) and artificial intelligence (ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI) venues.
Besides, I am the designer of several system projects, including [OpenBox](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box) and [MindWare](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/mindware). 
My research work is recognized by multiple prestigious awards, including the best student paper award at WWW 2022 and the doctoral dissertation award of ACM Beijing.

**Research Interests.**
I have a special focus on building next-gen autonomous solutions/systems to support machine learning and help facilitate data science.
My research interests include (1) **AI for Big Data**: *synergistic optimization between big data and artificial intelligence*,
(2) **Black-box Optimization**: *automatic tuning, such as knobs tuning in database system, config tuning in big data system, resource optimization and experiment design*, 
(3) **Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)**: *automatic hyperparameter optimization, adaptive model selection, pipeline search, and neural architecture search*,
and (4) **LLM-driven decision making**: *agentic AI methods*.
