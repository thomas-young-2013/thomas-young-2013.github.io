**Bio.** I am a senior researcher & engineer in the department of data platform, TEG, Tencent inc. 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Peking University in June 2022, advised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). 
And I spent one wonderful semester at ETH Zurich in 2019, working with [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.html).
I have published 20+ papers in the top database (SIGMOD, VLDB), data mining (KDD, WWW) and artificial intelligence (ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI) venues.
Besides, I am the designer of several system projects, including [OpenBox](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box), [MindWare](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/mindware) and [HyperTune](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/HyperTune). 
My research work is recognized by multiple prestigious awards, including the best student paper at WWW 2022, May Fourth Scholarship at Peking University 2021.

**Research Interests.**
I have a special focus on building automatic machine learning systems to support machine learning and help facilitate data science.
My research interests include (1) **AI + Big Data**: *synergistic optimization between big data and artificial intelligence*,
(2) **Black-box Optimization and its Application**: *automatic tuning, such as knobs tuning in database system, config tuning in big data system, resource optimization and experiment design*, 
and (3) **Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)**: *automatic hyperparameter optimization, adaptive model selection, pipeline search, and neural architecture search*.
