I am an machine learning researcher & engineer in the department of data platform, Technology and Engineering Group (TEG), Tencent inc. 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Peking University in June 2022, advised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). 
And I spent one wonderful semester at ETH Zurich in 2019, working with [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.html).

I have a special focus on building automatic machine learning systems to support machine learning and help facilitate data science.
The main applications of my research work include (1) automatic tuning, such as knobs tuning in database system, config tuning in big data system, resource optimization and experiment design, (2) automatic machine learning, such as automatic hyperparameter optimization, adaptive model selection, and pipeline search, 
and (3) synergistic optimization between big data and artificial intelligence. 
I have published 20+ papers in the top database (SIGMOD, VLDB), data mining (KDD, WWW) and artificial intelligence (ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI) venues.
My research work is recognized by multiple prestigious awards, including the best student paper at WWW 2022, May fourth Scholarship at Peking University 2021.
