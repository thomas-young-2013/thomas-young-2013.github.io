I am leading two AutoML open-source projects in the [DAIR](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/) Lab at Peking University:
* [OpenBox](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box): efficient system for generalized black-box optimization.
* [MindWare](https://github.com/thomas-young-2013/soln-ml): intelligent automatic machine learning system that supports multiple data input, including tabular, text, image and graph.
